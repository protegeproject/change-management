This readme takes you through the steps involved in building the
change management tab.  You will need the following jars:

   protege.jar
   protege-owl.jar
   rdf-backend.jar.

The sources for thes jars can be obtained from the following svn
repositories:

   http://smi-protege.stanford.edu/repos/protege/protege-core/trunk
   http://smi-protege.stanford.edu/repos/protege/owl/trunk
   http://smi-protege.stanford.edu/repos/protege/rdf-backend/trunk.

There are two ways of proceeding.  One method is to point the
environment variable PROTEGE_HOME to a valid Protege installation that
includes the owl plugin and the rdf-backend plugin.  The seond method
is to compile the jar files and copy the compiled jar files into the
lib directory and run "ant dist".  The dist directory will then
contain the change-management.zip file which can be unzipped into the
plugin directory of a protege distribution.  In addition the
change-management.jar file can be found in the directory
dist/edu.stanford.smi.protegex.changes.
