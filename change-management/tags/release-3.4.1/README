This readme takes you through the steps involved in building the
change management tab.  You will need the following jars:

   protege.jar
   protege-owl.jar
   rdf-backend.jar.

The sources for thes jars can be obtained from the following svn repositories:

   http://smi-protege.stanford.edu/repos/protege/protege-core/trunk
   http://smi-protege.stanford.edu/repos/protege/owl/trunk
   http://smi-protege.stanford.edu/repos/protege/rdf-backend/trunk.

Copy the compiled jar files into the lib directory and run "ant
dist".  The dist directory will then contain the change-management.zip
file which can be unzipped into the plugin directory of a protege
distribution.  In addition the change-management.jar file can be
found in the directory dist/edu.stanford.smi.protegex.changes.
